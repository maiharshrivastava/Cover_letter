    "LangChain is an open-source framework for developing applications powered by language models. It is designed to ease the process of building these applications by providing a set of tools that make it easier to connect language models to other data sources, interact with their environment, and build complex applications. It is a system composed of different parts that work together to make applications using natural language processing (NLP) run smoothly. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Interaction: This part helps LangChain talk to language models. It helps manage what goes into the model and understand what comes out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Connection and Retrieval: LangChain needs to handle the data that language models use. This part helps store and fetch that data from databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chains: When you're building more complex apps with LangChain, you might need different components or multiple language models. This part links them together in what's called an \"LLM chain.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents: Think of this as the decision-maker. It helps language models figure out the best actions to take by giving them a series of commands to respond to specific requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory: This part helps a language model remember the context of its interactions with users. It can remember things for a short time or for a long time, depending on what's needed."

    "In programming, we now use “prompts” as inputs for models. These prompts are not fixed; they’re made from different parts. LangChain helps us build these prompts easily. It also helps manage and optimize them. One of the key features of LangChain is the ability to create a prompt template. This template takes the user’s input and transforms it into a final prompt for the model. This approach allows for a more dynamic and flexible interaction with the model, enhancing its usability and effectiveness. Using LangChain’s prompt template, we have the opportunity to develop an application that accepts specific inputs such as position, company, and skills, ultimately generating a customised cover letter based on these parameters. We will be using the prompt template for our cover letter bot."
